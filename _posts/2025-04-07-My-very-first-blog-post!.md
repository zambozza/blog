title: "My very first blog post!"

This is my very first blog post! I have spent this afternoon building my basic blog site using Github Pages. GitHub provides functionality through GitHub pages to serve static web content using the Jekyll framework. Setting up the page in GitHub was pretty straightforward; the foundation for the site is a GitHub repository. The way the repository is configured means that GitHub Pages builds your site from content within the repository, and the content is written using Jekyll. At this point I am still only vaguely aware of what Jekyll is and does, so I have bookmarked a series of tutorial videos on the Jekyll website so I may work through them and maybe gain a better understanding of how to use it. I worked through the first tutorial and installed Jekyll on my Windows laptop, which involved using the Windows CLI to invoke the installation. I liked this method as it gave me just a little practice on using the CLI.

This week, I will continue on with my university studies, and perhaps dedicate 30 minutes each day to the Jekyll tutorials; hopefully within a week or two I will have a broader understanding of the framework, allowing me to develop my blog site a little more. Although Jekyll and languages like HTML and CSS aren't part of my official studies, it seems prudent to gain at least a basic understanding of them given their ubiquity. I'd also like to customise the aesthetic of my blog site and perhaps add some more functionality, but we will see. I also own a custom domain and I would eventually like to link my blog site to the URL.

For now, at least, it seems that I have a (basically) functioning blog! Hopefully I will remember how to post to it this time next week!
